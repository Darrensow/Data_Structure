My name is Darren Sow Zhu Jian with matrix number, U2005252. I am majoring in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence). This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this subject. This is because I'm not really familiar with programming languages.

I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will put in twice the amount of work. Wish me luck!!!

It’s me again. Finally, it’s the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did well in this course. I was happy with my performance on this course and I throughly enjoyed programming. DS has taught me that there will always be a more efficient structure to handling a particular problem. I'm not sure my target grade is changed or not as the results are not released yet. But I'm feeling confident that I will score. I did well communicating with my group members on the group assignment and I was particularly happy with that. The thing is, I'm not sure what I can do better. If I were to pinpoint something, I would say I would be happier if I could study harder about DS. But as they said, 'Time is a luxury not many can enjoy'.
