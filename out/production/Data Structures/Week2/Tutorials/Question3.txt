What is a raw type? Why is a raw type unsafe? Why is the raw type allowed in Java?

A raw type is a generic class/interface that is used without specifying a concrete type/without a type parameter.
The reference type that is formed by taking the name of a generic type declaration without an accompanying type argument list.

Raw types are unsafe because bypass generic type checks, deferring the catch of unsafe code to runtime.

Raw type are allowed in Java is only as a concession to compatibility of legacy code and the use of raw types in code written after the introduction of generic programming into Java Language is discouraged.
